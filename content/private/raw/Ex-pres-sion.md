I struggle a lot in expressing myself using language. Since Language is mainly useful that way, you can imagine how much potential I fail to collect from it. To be able to express my thoughts exactly as they are – so that someone basically pierces through my brain and then collects and decodes my ideaes – is a skill I have been chasing for a long time.

Although expressing using language can be done by speaking, we can all agree that writing can convey more. That's what I've been learning. One of my struggle is to be able to express exactly how I want a concept to be  explained. I would read a concept in a book, then another, and the go on exploring without ever being satisfied by the explanations. Even if I end up grasping the idea, it won't be easy for me to share it because, well I can't express myself.

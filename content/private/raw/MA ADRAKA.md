When Allah(s.w) Asks in the Qur'an (frequently)  about something and then proceeds to ask that: "And what will make you realise what this something is", and then proceeds to explain what that something is, he means that:
1. We didn't know about this something
2. It's something of significance to us
2. It's the Qur'an that reveals the meaning for the first time, or for the first time to us.
3. Calls upon disbelievers to bring forth something similar (a description, or meaning) from those scriptures they think the Qur'an copies from.

1. The illusion of Free speech: what exactly is free? Is speech a one way entity?
2. The beating of Women and its misconception: Wisdom, the linear thoughts, trying to fit religion to our desires instead of searching for meaning, Abraham example of what God can commands, the wisdom, the fact that this is not between any man and some woman, but two pillars of generations, two lovers, and such that there's always something leading to this. The fact that resolution like this will make the pillars firm and establish authority, and the fact that the pain is not physical: don't be stupid to think of it in the physical realm: this can be more painful to a man than to a woman. The fact that this is not a ruling of desires, that a man discipline her wife not because it was his plan, or because he's angry but because it has reached a point where he's supposed or adviced to do so according to religion.

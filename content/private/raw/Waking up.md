It's a state/feeling that's best satisfied by just staying there, eyes wide open but not fucused, thinking about nothing but how to time those deep and shallow breaths so that the whole body feels the relaxation. You could replace the wide eyes with an emotional piano song and redirection of brain to the lyrics or notes. The entire body always semi-paralysed. At this state I'm semi hungry: I can eat but I feel better staying hungry. At this state I've just woke up in the morning.

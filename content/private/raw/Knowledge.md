Knowledge is what changes ones behaviour

You may be a believer and you may hate some of your traits. You hate certain people and some traits that seems innate. 

But once you understand, once you get the knowledge, that's when you'll understand. Understanding can be the reason for you to love. Knowledge can be the reason for kill the hatred 

It's true that we get some bad traits from genes. That's Allah's design. Genetic behaviours are hard to notice, once noticed they are hard to accept or live with or experience, and once you fight them, they are hard to eliminate. It takes a special knowledge to change what you usually do, and that knowledge exists.

No the problem is that the knowledge is known by almost everyone. And even when known, you just can't seem to do things differently. The truth is, you have not grasped the knowledge.

Who knows whether I'm deserving or not? Who can possibly convince you to forgive me? 
I feel so scared that you may never forgive me, truly. Even though you may say it 
and act it, only you will have the true idea. But nothing can stop me from asking 
your forgiveness. It is this moment when, Even the slightest probability extremely matters. Today, at this moment, I can move one without it but my life will never be the same again. 

I can't keep thinking about how hard it is for you to be angry at me. or I'm I delusional?

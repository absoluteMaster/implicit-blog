Sometimes when I ride a shared  private home with quite strangers I'm always calculating. I can't really afford to fall victim to criminals. If I had a chance to get a plate number, I share it to  someone so that atleast I can raise the probability of my body and the criminals to be found. If we passed a potential place that could be my destination, my pressures falls 90%.

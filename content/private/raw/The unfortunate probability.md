Sometimes it is possible until it's official

At times when it didn't exist in your calculations, it happened and it was astonishing. Now that
you want to officially do it, it seems absolutely impossible. You get bored or tired and lose interest 
The thing you complain to be impossible is on the level you can reach and even surpass. Do you have 
patience to return to the level, or was it really luck. Well, there's never luck in most of these 
occurences but you can never ignore the slightest bit of probability. So why ignore the plenty which 
points at your powers and keeps insisting?. Unless it is something insignificant like throwing an empty 
bottle in a distant bin, never give up in waking the discovered quality you have.

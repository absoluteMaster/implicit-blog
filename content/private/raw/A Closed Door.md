So I used to spend a lot of my time playing around with new formulas or concepts from class or books, and sometimes I come across some trends or connections that I study and try to generalize. One day I had this very complicated result from a long game with some trigonometry and calculus concepts. Some family of big formulas that instantly made me very satisfied. That was just a few days after being introduced to calculus. I didn't know what to do with it: like where do I submit this?, can I give it a name?. I decided to keep it, and maybe have some time to look at it daily for that feeling of satisfaction. Later on I came across the same formula, so small and concise and rigorously explained. It's derivation was simple and logical so that you know where it came from and where it can lead you to. I never felt so defeated.

It's a dream to create things I've never seen before. Today I call this personal invention because someone else might have made the same thing some times ago. Deep down I still hope that it’s a "plain" invention; that not only me, but also no one else have seen it before. The math world that I’m trying to put my mark in is just so much advanced. Any result you come up with is probably hundreds of years old. To make something new, now that I think, requires you to have enough advanced knowledge so that you can at most add some more advanced results. It's as if everything is in its place. Almost all of the times, inventions are personal; something unfamiliar to you is almost always familiar to many others.

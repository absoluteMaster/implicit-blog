Perhaps the most obvious lesson we learn from fasting is how easily we take for granted the blessing of food: not only getting it, but also having the ability to eat and enjoy it. How we do not take seriously the pleads of homeless when they ask for food or money. One of things that keeps us intact with our fast is the confirmed availability of iftaar. We count the minutes and seconds, we take in the pain knowing that it'll eventually end. But imagine taking on this pain with no any hope of getting food. Imagine going on for two days. Imagine three, four. Imagine having this routine for years. Don't wait for God's hands to touch you, Always be prepared to share with those who are in need. Don't judge who deserves it. Imagine you with all what you have deciding to go on Streets to ask for food. Doesn't make sense right? In other words, They all need it, whether they are abled or disabled. Whether they are clean or dirty. Hunger is Cancerous.

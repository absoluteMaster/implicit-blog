Being rich or poor is nothing. You are what you are. Allah tests you with what you have: the rich with their wealth, the poor with their needs, each with an equal weight of test and equal intensity. There's no need to act or seek for wealth hoping that it will help you in the coarse to Jannah. Everything you will have is already designed for you since birth, even if you might think it's from your hardwork.

God created us from twyn and then gave us specific time to live on earth. Maybe the time given to us is a function of the collective blessings and trials God has planned for is in such a way that we all have equal chance to succeed Allah's tests. The probability that this time is calculated is intelligently higher that this time is random. But maybe it's a function of more than just this, a complex function beyond comprehension.

The state of the mind, the strength of the heart. Even the most toughest cry. 

But is there a way, or a thought injection that can prepare even the most fragile of hearts, the weakest in mind, for the toughest cry? 

The ultimate state of awareness.

The being that's you will only stay relevant alive. There has never been a single person whose death made activity on earth stop, or civilisation go backward. Is there any? 

The miracle for me is the diversity in what we can handle, and how that is what makes us forever dependent. The struggle has always been having what others depend on because that way you get from them what you depend on. This is the basic, the foundation of everything you do. Is it?

Is there any struggle in your life that is not about getting something from others or for others or before others?


Nothing that's outstanding can come from birth. You just have to be lucky enough to get the best out of what you have out of the box. If you have a good heart, you can be a weak person or a good person. If you have a good eye you can be a i good sniper.

I forgot what I wanted to say: life, a lot of times, has that power to make it
even more regrettable. But it was not like a message to humanity, No. It was 
something a little more like taking it off my chest and a lot more like expanding 
my database of documented ideas. Ideas originating purely and but not totally from
my underrated mind. Documentation is the only weapon available to fight against the 
most common idesolving.

It's not good to laugh at people's failure, but sometimes their failure is so
beneficial to you you end up happilly laughing. An instance of off-the-bat bad 
moral making a 180 because of the vastness of a phenomenon; Failure, indeed, has 
got one heck of an explosive bunch of alternatives, in Definition.

I nearly got bitten by a snake, but it was too small according to those witnesses,
far too small for me to jump like I did. It was night and the snake was behind me. I 
jumped right away and finally had a chance to see the beast I was running from, but it
was small. Far too small for me to jump in fear like that. I argued that I didn't know
about the size, that a big man like me wouldn't run away from a such a tiny animal. 
But I know better. Snakes freak me out, whether small or big. Even those far too small
for me to be freaked. 

Sometimes you become a victim of others affairs. You become a victim they are so sad 
about, but really you were out of the equation. Out of the picture. Like a side effect,
you become a side victim, totally unaware of why it's happening to you. Sometimes the
real villains don't even realise there was a side victim. Others don't care much about
the side victim as most patients are about side effects of some medicines. There's 
nothing so bad like being a side victim

The Power of Staying Unknown
The Silent death

Tuesday 9th November 2021

Can you keep a dramatic moment to yourself? The energy it takes, 
do you have it? What if nothing can be gained to anyone from your story? 
If you gain nothing from it, why do it? Is it show off?

Inspired from the PowerStation blast a few moments and a few metres after fill in.

We can't.

Is this some kind of natural phenomenon? I doubt that. 
But then again, my experience says otherwise. But what about yours? 
Probably the same huh? We just can't keep it to ourselves. 

Most of the times we put on a delay but eventually, we burst out. 
we spill. We're too helpless, I guess.

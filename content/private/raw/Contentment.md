Talking points:

01.
Sometimes you speak to someone and she doesn't hear it, and you 
become relieved, later, that she didn't. ( What if she ignored, ha!)

02.
The value, the meaning of a faceless, nameless, silent help, 
and it's status when the credit is taken by, stolen by or 
given to someone undeserving.

03.
If you die, I'll kill you.

Raw:

On What situations
would you rather have your assistance recognized? Many.

Growing up I was taught to give so that the left 
hand doesn't (not right) recognize what the right hand did (not give).

When a religion formalizes it, you know it's not particularly
easy for the common man, the "man out of the box".

Doesn't matter our true desire for helping, something definitely
not so easy, when we help, a part of us wants that recognition, 
or at least expects it. We actually prefer praises than giving 
and therefore when we succeed, we get thirsty of thanks and recognition.
 1. Is it because of the income-outcome living we've been worshiping? 
 2. Does that discredit the deed?

situations:

the receiver; 
1. The receiver doesn't recognize the giver.
2. The receiver doesn't know he's been helped. ( vigilance eg )
3. The receiver, unlike the giver, doesn't consider it help.
4. 

the giver;
1. The giver consciously doesn't consider it help.
2. The giver, unlike the receiver, doesn't realize he's helped.
3. The giver doesn't recognize the receiver.
4. 

a. the giver openly wants to be known (publicly). 
b. the giver silently wants to be known.
c. the giver can't handle being known, but wants to be known. 
d.

* why did God gave us the Samian baswira?

* At a point in time, and as long as you're alive, when you finally decide to submit to Allah, that you have tried enough, that you know the right path but can't seem to be able to follow it by will, that this is submission of control, that you want him to guide you, that it's better to just take your life because you can't be sure to succeed in doing rightous deeds.

* He created you
* Thumma qadhaa ajala
* He created you from nutfat amshaj
* So that he may test you
* So he gave you sight and hearing
*

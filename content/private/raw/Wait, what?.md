Your families aren't so distant. The kind of neighbors who have to trust each other, but they really do. So you grew up together in the brightness of the day and the darkness of the night. You friends are so closer, but within the realistic range: It's not like you can die for each other. But you like this friend because he can take care of stuff. This friend of yours, you think, is more into you than you are into him. He looks like he'll always be there. 

20 years later, you guys are strangers. The twists and turns, the most probable functions of time have taken quite some dominance in your life. He couldn't recognize you and you know it's okay, who would? At a distance, you take a look at him and he's a different person, not that childhood friend you once had. You are amazed by his appearance but then you realize everyone is. You can't approach him like he's some ordinary guy. You can tell he's got some good things going on. Looks like for him, more success is just half a step away and in any direction. A type you'd feel small in their presence. You no longer have the energy to chase a friend, nor the confidence to face him.

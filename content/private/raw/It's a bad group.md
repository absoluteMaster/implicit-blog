What happens when someone or a group of very skilled beings have so much experience of the world.
and not just some 100 year experience or thousand year experience, I'm talking about all possible
years experience. These people knows all the ways to success and can help people into achieving 
things that may seem impossible at first. Now imagine they formed an association for the people
promising them riches and success

As a group of this quality, they can accumulate enough wealth to ese as a bait in pulling new members
of the group. so many people have hardships and can almost do anything for money. When asked to join 
the group they accept and two things may happen: given a working opportunity, given a working solution, 
given a starting balance or given a strong connection. what they see though, is that they are given 
money and success even though everything is a product of their talent and hard work.

I guess I need to start writing again and strengthen my arguments for this topic. I know I have the 
right intuition and I'm heading the right direction for this issue. I'll start by making a few research
on the group so as to make a connection between the group and my claims. this will also make it easy 
for me to formulate even more hypotheses.

We group time in finite chunks which themselves present finite
chunks of time. The bigger chunks made it possible to have times. 
If we viewed them as giants, then the seconds and minutes, and other 
smaller chunks of time, will eat them away and keep eating. You may 
wish to imagine them so hungry at the beginning so that time moves fast, 
that sometimes they get full and time doesn't seem to move. But they are 
never full, and with them, infinite appetites. As slow and as fast as it 
may seem, time  never changes its pace. And it keeps moving so that even 
when it seems slow, eventually it will come to pass. Even if it feels 
so fast, nothing which is a function of time, produce than normal.

Assumptions: 
* The truth is subjective 
* It may be from a parent or a teacher
* Or may come from within

What does the majority say? Why?
What does the minority say? Why?
What do you say?

What the majority thinks the truth is a broad view to be considerered systematically. We first realise that we all pass the stage where the elements of truth in all aspects of life are introduced and installed in us by those with control over us until we reach the age where we can make decisions and choices, and we can only do so with appropriate knowledge of the issue or with an even stronger external influence so that what felt like the truth then becomes falsity.


""" 
Until we reach a stage where can decide to choose a version of truth. At this stage we have the ability to think and distinguish correctly to the extent of our knowledge. With it we can internally know what the truth really is and it's up to us whether we showcase of live it within the 

"""

From this we can clearly see that something is a truth derived from these things:
1. Influence: One can be convinced that falsity is the actual truth.
2. Knowledge: One can differentiate truth from falsity after accumulating relevant knowledge, the same way one can mistake falsity as truth due to ignorance.


The society instills beliefs in us making us view the truth according to the society.  To blend in, it's crucial to understand the accepted truth the same way we have to accept the teacher's version of truth if we are to pass his test. Now 

In general, the truth that's generally accepted or known is that which 

This is, but a not so brief way of saying that the truth is actually a subjective reality to humans. But this subjectivity is of two types: actually subjective and unfortunately subjective. Actually subjective truths are naturally subjective such that the truth is not distinctively unique. These are truths which are functional and depends on the entities involved. Unfortunately subjective truths are those whose subjectivity 







What's the truth by

To define the word truth would

The truth exists in a set of two or more elements. When a set is conceived well, only one element should be the truth. But often times, the set is consists of more than one truth element.

An ideal set has one value as the truth. But since such a set.

When generally searching for the truth, the set may not always ideal, that is, consist of all possible truth elements.
A
The truth depends on the subject:


Let's divide the entities involved into three :
subject on whom the truth is significant. The truth is somehow relevant to this man.
* The subject of interest which projects truth values or perspectives. The "what" in "the truth about what"
* 

It's necessary that we cancel our the existing concepts of truth that won't help but make it harder to grasp the nature or discuss the nuances of literal truth.

The subjective truth: where the truth actually depends on the 
conditional truth, uncertainty.

* This question is disturbingly broad in a number of ways. I didn't know where to start, and if I don't know where to start, I won't know when to stop. Just like that, it was past Monday midnight, and all I had were chunks of paragraphs, each with it's own beginning but no ending â€”and impossible to combine. Now is this the truth?

We conclude the following from the statements above:
* The actual truth exists with absolute certainty.
* Only I know the truth with absolute certainty.
* You can never confirm the truth and thus can only believe or disbelieve.
* Let's call me the holder and you the seeker. We're the two subjects involved.



TRUTH is a property of something: a sentence, a proposition, a thought, a belief and so on. The nature of truth depends on how each of these entities are constructed. A sentence "Eating too much is unhealthy"

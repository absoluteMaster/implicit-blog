Someone says her life is special. I prefer not to comment about that sentence. I don't call myself such
but (because) it's obvious to almost all I'm connected with. But now it's even more obvious that me and her,
ah!, I'm not any better. Don't jump into conclusion, do not categorise us, just dont's discriminate so early.
As it turns out, it includes all of us, and that's jus natural.

Without any effort nature successfully managed to place all of us into ane group. Creating sub-groups from that 
group is outwardly "obviously easy", but to truly achieve that has never been a simple task. That's especially when 
the terms good and bad, right and wrong are involved. Desipite toughness of the task, one can almost endlessly create
distinct sub-groups, the credits going to nature once again.

Nature ensured that, new members into the group have unique make up and alot. Depending on how, when and where he 
grew, a member can widen his membership in subgroups, or traverse any member of such. Consequently, someone with 
a task of creating subgroups is subjected to richness and/of diversity, if and only if, he is a true explorer.

But why on earth is it a tough task? : Interconnectedness.

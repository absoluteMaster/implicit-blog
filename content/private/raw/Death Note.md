If you can predict your death, why don't you prepare?. Or did you prepare, like, was there 
any preparations I didn't know of?. You are a disgrace to your family and the clan. Everybody 
expected something from the gifts you were given by Allah(s.w). It is as if you didn't deserve 
any of them. A healthy family, no conflicts, no hunger, no death, no any issues. Your family 
prospered year after year by the grace of God. What did you do to deserve all these?. Acting 
like the School isn't for you?, like you don't care anymore about the blessings?. What?, 
do you think we don't observe your movements?. We're just glad you're gone but we'll cry for 
that, and also for the fact that we do really mean what we say.

I'll cry because I don't 
believe you're prepared yet, I don't really care about your accomplishments and arrogance. 
I do care about what's next for you. I mean you were a really good guy but you're the only 
person who really knows the truth about that fact. Until now I know I'm not, but your death 
has given me a new push and path, a new reminder and reason. I don't feel good that I'm getting 
advantage on your death, but you can't choose the blessings. But for this, I'll never forget you
and I'll commit myself to praying for you in all my prayers so that Allah can show mercy on you.
So that we can meet together again and I being able to tell you something. It's not too late to 
turn to your Master.

Sometimes a sudden mood visits me in any shape I'm in and keeps pestering me into doing what it's about. Today it's about the writing act, or the typing urge. I don't need a topic and It's not about typing or 
writing, it's about an act of typing, that action. Now that I've already gained rythm and pushing power, I feel as if something inside of me have been lifted, the mind feels so clear and happy, the happiness I 
can really feel. Sometimes It's amazing how you can feel this way out of such a mere conduct, or is it because such is not a mere conduct?. Is writing so sacred that it can just produce such powers out of thin air?. Well, that may or may not require much of the research for validation but one thing was just proved now: writing has the power, and with that power, I've just developed a new topic for this piece.

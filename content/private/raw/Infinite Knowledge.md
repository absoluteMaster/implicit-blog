2. Reason about everything, why everything, because logically there's an infinite knowledge. Why we can literally decide to abstain from the bad but still manage to. E pulled by it every time? Shaitan. Remember, .....unless acted upon an external force..

3: Logic is infinite: God's Knowledge is infinite. His methods are perfect. He's capable of everything. It's safe to say that an argument exists that can explain why everything is what it is.

According to Quran 36:82, Allah is capable of anything. He created everything.

Our knowledge has limits. In other words, it can be quantified or enclosed. But it's contained in Allah's unlimited knowledge. It's possible to create anything with it using the help of the universal knowledge.




It is accurate to say that there is an infinite amount of information and understanding that we currently do not know. There are numerous aspects of reality, from the taste of the center of Jupiter to the exact origins of the Earth, that remain beyond our current knowledge and understanding.

However, the knowledge we possess at any given instance is finite. It is limited to what has been discovered, learned, and understood up to that point in time. Our current knowledge is a subset of all possible knowledge that exists and can exist.

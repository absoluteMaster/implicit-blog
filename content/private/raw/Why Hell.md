The results of our actions are considered in Allah's plans.(?)

If you perform zinah, then surely Allah has already put an order in this universe: women give birth

The fate of the infant is affected By his parents: street children are sold and held captive, it's a possibility.

He gave us guidance: if you "think", the chances of it happening are down under his path, and that's decreed. It's written.

Now, Evil people exists: you don't need a proof, right?

Why Hellfire? Why Severe punishment? 
To bring justice to a kid tortured and raped and killed because it's just not fair. 

Imagine you are born, "trans"-formed, Sold and treated as an object, die brutally and no one even knows about it, or cares. 

There surely has to be an extraordinary justice system that transcends ours just for the sake of making every thing right. 

There comes the Judgement Day and it's master: The almighty Allah. One who knows Everything, sees everything and he's the best of judges. 

Have you tried Allah's guidance and find it wrong? Have you measured it against other ways that you prefer? Why do you arrogantly dismiss it without knowledge? Have you ever read the Qur'an?

Surely, Allah Guides whoever he wills, Does whatever he likes, And he's most capable over everything.



* Islam has always been a battle of oneself. The wight of personal responsibilities is substantial. 
* The most fundamental verses in the Qur'an are most open, obvious and direct. They are the ultimate cheat codes such that consistency in one can be just enough. Yet they are most neglected in their true form.
* The weight of knowledge is not just scary, it's terrifying. Knowledge has great responsibility.
* The amount of obvious cheat codes in islam is incomprehensible and looks too easy to feel real and effective, let alone true. Yet it's always almost impossible to be consistent in any.

* When someone rejects the path, he's bound to do harm on earth. This harm can reach you. When Allah punishes them, it's because they hurt you. When Allah warns them, it's so that they do not hurt you. The Judgement day will deliver justice that the human ways cannot offer: the ultimate justice. The accountability which will seem as if it's about them, but it's really about you.

* If you win the battle about yourself here, then you'll only ever be the victim in the judgement day. Your compensation will be the paradise. 

* The fact that it was always a battle of yourself for others showcases the ultimate mercy of Allah. That all those Muslims pray only so that you ultimately get safety or provision or shelter, and not because god wants their prayer. 

* Think about it, we're living here as a test. A test for what? It's a test of whether we can keep 

* The reject you bundled alongside fine products for that customer and got away with it will be accounted for. 





God's Design  Vs God's Plan

* that's why Allah is the one who holds us together and prevents chaos. 


* That's why destroyed qaums because they would corrupt his creation. Thay dest noruction is an act of love

* The fact that death is at a designated time means that Allah(s w) intervenes, or it's aproof that he does that, or.  

* The fact that he decides your parents means he's decided...

* after all, any man can only do what he's capable of doing. Everything you do is what you can or less. Remember that you 

* There can also be a spiritual level design that runs controls deep, and that's not obvious but always achieved. And that leads us to seek the and follow the guidance. 

For example the fact that what you did to someone's child will be done to your child???+

* We're actually living In a real time situation: it's not a defined state such that what will happen next has already been planned. It means an accident can happen anytime depending on us, others or the environment. That means Allah's mercy keeps us up an moving.

* When it's said that all has been written or planned, or that Allah knows it all, it literally means so. But not the way we think. What's been planned is the action response design of the world. That a bullet in the head will hurt, that team work will always make great works. All this is Allah's design. All this and gravity and rainfall etc. And the fact that a seed will grow to a huge tree.

* He brings the rain by maintaining the system. There's no such a system that just works without power and maintenance we should know better. 

* Allah talks in abstractiom words that 

* One blessings from God transcends generations and that's how powerful the ability to change the course of the divine design.


* We all know the evil inside us is much worse than we can imagine. A man could do a lot of sins if he was given a chance. The fact that we're not able to do it is a huge blessing from Allah. It's about time we start being grateful for the less we have: less materials, less access, less health etc. It's also a sign that we should not be to judgemental to others. Could we have done better if we were given the same blessings by Allah(s.w)? 



* Islam  comes to add clarity on the purpose of life
* Promise reward on the good deeds which are known to everyone naturally
* Put community principles in action, those which we can never agree on by ourselves
* Tell us about ghaib, things we would or  can never comprehend even by the extreme 



It's like knowing yourself well while understanding the boundless reach of Allah (s.w). You know your true intentions and you know that Allah knows. And that that's enough. You know when you collect the thawabs one by one and that it's written never to be forgotten or overlooked. You know when you do wrong, and choose to repent. And you understand the penalty of breaking your vows to Allah(s.w).

Allah(s.w) knows what's inside our hearts, what we conceal and reveal. Allah (s.w) is the most merciful, most just and the best of judges.

Allah says, he will guide those who wants to be guided

Can I believe that the Qur'an can give you a special understanding of its verses?
Can reading the Qur'an mislead you?

I'm in love with the Qur'an. It's the only book that's amazing when read, listened or understood. This is much bigger than you would think. It means that an honest soul can be called to Islam by the sound of it. A believer can strengthen his Iman by reading it even without understanding it - an unfortunately popular case. A man of reason can be called to Islam by understanding it. Notice how a dishonest soul is left behind. No it's not left behind, but unlike others, It's misguided. Notice how the Qur'an leaves up to its verse, that it was sent to all human kind. But what it does to human kind is unbelievably diverse.

But understanding the Qur'an doesn't mean you're free from being misguided. There's Shaitwan, there's ignorance. That's why you must ask Allah(s.w) to protect you from Shaitwan when reading the Qur'an.

Allah says: He guides whoever he wishes and misguides whoever he wishes. What does the dishonest soul, or the ignorant, or the one who forgot to ask for Allah's permission understand from this verse? Well, something like "what's the point of the day of judgement"? 


But are those who Allah(s.w) wishes to guide strangers? Did he not talk about them already? Whoever? Is that an arrogant tone. But doesn't Allah(s.w) do whatever he pleases?

Whoever? Isn't it the synonym of "any". Could it mean anyone can be Muslim?

Didn't Allah(s.w) specify in this Qur'an the people that he wishes to misguide?

So what does this ayat means? When it means exactly what it said. Any definition is valid. Indeed Allah(s.w) can guide whoever he wills.

But what does it imply? It implies that you do not question Allah's principles.

This is how the Qur'an is written. You don't simply understand the verse. And a verse may have multitude of meaning literally or depending on the context of the Sura or near verses. Not every meaning will be available to you, and not all meanings will be right.

Do we owe parents for what they've done to us? If giving us what we need is
the source of their happiness. What is love? Is it their responsibility to 
feed us? If you weren't going to feed me, why give birth to me?

You don't know whether to invade her privacy or not. You don't know if he needs 
you now or not. Is it better to be with her now? or to leave her alone. You want

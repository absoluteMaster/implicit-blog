Allah is known to know all the past and all the future, a power that's so hard to get past. Most of the times we ask ourselves: So does he already know who's is to hell and who's to Jannah? But then what's the purpose of being here, why not just get done with it? "What makes sense makes up Religion" is a series of paragraphs that aim at breaking down tight  Religious concepts to the level of common sense and in the process revealing God's Majestic ways of running things. 

"They plan and Allah plans, and Allah is the best of planners"  (Quran 3:54) 

The first time I read this verse I had goosebumps all over. It was shared by Andrew Tate on his Twitter account, at a perfect time, and It has since been answering the biggest questions I always had. Today I want to start from common sense all the way to Quran(3:45).

The future is a puzzle to his creation, but it's not always obvious to them. A worker who has been in the same work routine for a month could probably predict what will generally happen tomorrow before work, at work and after work. He can then plan to do something at a break time, and he'll do it the way he planned to. To these and many people the future is perceived as the next 5, 10 years and not later or tomorrow and definitely not the next second. But it is. And it's not always the function of our plans. That there's a master planner behind it all, who knows it all. But how?, and why?

At the core of our lives are plans and living is their execution. Whatever we plan will involve ourselves and one or more, but limited amount of people we probably know. But the world is of billions who interact in ways they know and they don't. The mere existence of other people is the first thing that can affect our plans. They plan and we plan, everyone in their own understanding and with their own goals. But only one team has to win. It takes one man to postpone a meeting of 10s, one phone call to ruin the next seconds. The future you lightly thought inevitable is taking an unexpected turn.

We may also be the cause without expecting because we never know what's going on inside our bodies, whether a heart attack is seconds away, or a cancer is spreading. The micros don't make noises.......

(Three things always happen: The plan happens they way  it's supposed to, or It happens the way you wanted, or God's Plan takes precedence)

Under the hot sun. Probably hungry and thirsty - an uncomfortable state you can never get used to. But her legs are nowhere. And hands. And Family. And she's not beautiful. She's been there all day asking busy pedestrians for something. She's everything you'd rather not be. But then you look at yourself. You not only have legs, but can also run. But you shamefully dance.

A lot of us struggle to understand God's wisdom on this matter. Most of us don't even care to understand. Everyone, after all, has got problems of their own to deal with. Those with legs will hate their legs for being thick and their nails for being shapeless. Those with eyes will hate their eyebrows and will struggle to solve this apparently big issue. Those with money will struggle in relationships. 

No one chooses problems to suffer from, but everyone does two things: complain that he's suffering more, Wish he never suffer like certain someone. But Everyone knows, at a moment, someone exists who suffers a lot more than someone else, at least according to him or what we see.

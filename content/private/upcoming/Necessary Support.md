Some group of people eventually decide to invest their time and money in helping the needy, personally or by convincing the successful. They form these religious or non-profit organization to make the world a better place for all.

Let's assume that in these organizations, the receivers of help are really in need of help and not forced into receiving what they don't want. And it is the kind of help that is actually beneficial to them in ways that they know or they don't. And after accepting help, they are not manipulated into doing things they don't know about.

I know most of these organizations are corrupt these days. But for today, let's assume that all organization do not enslave the recipients by expecting a return of any kind, all the money reaches the targeted groups of people and all the sponsors have no ulterior motives like fame, politics or show off. Let's just assume all the conspiracies are not true.

Some recipients are absolutely helpless so that everything should be done for them. Any treatment, to them, may look okay. Maybe because they have no say or because they are not exposed enough. let's assume that they always get the treatment they would have if they were in opposite situations.

One of my dreams is to create a similar organization one day. Let's assume my dream came true, that I have what it takes to create and manage such an organization. So, today I decided to organize a scholarship program. I like to believe in education, and I want to help people get education. 

But I always challenge many things about scholarships while knowing a little about them. It's difficult for me to understand those government scholarships from countries whose majority citizens are also in need of such assistance. Today I remove all the complexities about scholarships, reduce the possible recipients by  grouping, and possibly doing all this according to what I think is true. Then I ask you a question, who deserves my scholarships? is it the poor or the clever?

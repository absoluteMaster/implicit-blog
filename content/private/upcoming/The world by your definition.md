At the beginning, oh no! I shouldn't start here because, how did it all begin anyway? I won't go too many years ago and miss out many out of the box and more relevant cases from some few centuries ago. So, a few centuries ago, there was no printers. Everything had to be written by hand. Can you Imagine the world today without printers? The invention of the printing press gave us the incredible access to books which are, from a deeper view, one of the driving force to all other inventions. 

Johannes Gutenberg created something from a combination of what he'd learned as a goldsmith and his thoughts. He is not the only one who knew the problem with hand-copying, but is among the few who pursued the solution. He is also not guaranteed to have more knowledge among those who shared similar goal around the world. But they all had the chance and luckily, after enough hard work, the core idea was open to him before all others.

If there was a time before something, then I still believe you don't need to learn everything. With basic skills you can come up with great ideas that, just like all other ideas already formulated, still lingers around in the streets and in people and situations and even yourself. There's a great chance for collision, but today, with all the many existing ideas, that's more than enough success. It will expose your genetic similarities with other creators, setting you up for the coming adventures in the everlasting invention land.
 An Invention at work. An invention is one that solves a problem.

But wait, it's not that simple. I can't dis-value such great works of the outliers and their mental powers with some logical arguments only. Taking a deeper look at things we realize that, compared to the majority ever lived, the inventors can be considered infinitesimal. I mean let's be honest, inventing is not something anyone can do. Even if we all have the chances to invent the unknown, the chances are not equal. Most of the time an invention is a function of time, opportunity , access to information and sometimes variables we can't even realize or understand. Some people are just smarter than you and you know it.

So, such arguments, however true or accurate, are just for encouragement. They should give you hope and keep you in position. After all, not all of us have the same chance to invent it, at a time it's not there already. Inventing is a rigid game. a lot of things play their parts and you probably are not on the most favorable side or time. The argument ensures that there's always something to invent so that at every instance in your lifetime you have the chance to invent and not a single reason to give up. So it's up to you to raise your odds and you know how. I pray that one day we'll learn about the world by your definition.

The best of all medicine is resting and fasting  -- Benjamin Franklin


Once in a while we set off in search of life hacks. For some really cornered people, this is their daily thing. Thanks to the vastness of knowledge, these hacks are so many. But they all share one feature: they are all generally basic knowledge which suggests against our beloved way of doing things. They have this deeper argument against the life most of us choose, the passive life of doing things because others do them, or because it's comfortable and easy that way. The kind of life that takes with great care those simple short term pleasures and keep wanting more of them, as if addicted. This explains why most of us can't keep up will all the hacks we get all the time.

I tried the Intermittent fasting hack in 2020 when I, once again, decided to start afresh. The hack is biologically supported and works as hell. It was originally supposed to make me smart, but it went beyond that. My practice was extreme and the results were just what I wanted. Actually I combined it with that of less talk  and intense exercise and, in just a week, things started kicking in. I started seeing things very clearly. I was quite but my mind was so loud. I stopped judging things rashly. It was the bomb. I became someone else. I became something else. 

One thing about fasting people don't understand: Fasting is not about forcing yourself not to eat the whole day just to eat as if there's no tomorrow at the evening. Fasting is more about controlling yourself on food. It's about being able to completely ignore delicious food in front of you without having regrets or second thoughts. It's about being able to control the amount of food you eat when opening your fast. Fasting because you don't have food is actually starving.

( to be continued .... )


Perhaps the most obvious lesson we learn from fasting is how easily we take for granted the blessing of food: not only getting it, but also having the ability to eat and enjoy it. How we do not take seriously the pleads of homeless when they ask for food or money. One of things that keeps us intact with our fast is the confirmed availability of iftaar. We count the minutes and seconds, we take in the pain knowing that it'll eventually end. But imagine taking on this pain with no any hope of getting food. Imagine going on for two days. Imagine three, four. Imagine having this routine for years. Don't wait for God's hands to touch you, Always be prepared to share with those who are in need. Don't judge who deserves it. Imagine you with all what you have deciding to go on Streets to ask for food. Doesn't make sense right? In other words, They all need it, whether they are abled or disabled. Whether they are clean or dirty. Hunger is Cancerous.

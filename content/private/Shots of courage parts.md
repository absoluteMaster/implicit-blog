Under the hot sun, she's hungry and thirsty. It's an uncomfortable state you have never gotten used to. She has no legs. Her hands have no family to hold onto. She's not beautiful to at east account for that little attention she gets all day, asking busy pedestrians for anything. She's everything you'd rather not be. You look at her and realize you have legs and you could run. ==But you shamefully dance==.




You then argue that I am blubbering without context, and you're right. Even in dangerous situations, it is our bodies that will make instinctive Judgements. When stretched, It's as if God is telling us, "Don't judge a book by its cover," and when you must, "I've got you covered." But the point was you could run, and you know it.

Are you talking about the woke begger? 


Under the hot sun, she's hungry and thirsty. It's an uncomfortable state you have never gotten used to. She has no legs to take her places. Her hands have no family to hold onto. She's not beautiful to at east account for that little attention she gets all day, asking busy pedestrians for anything. She's everything you'd rather not be. You look at her and realize you have legs and you could run. ==But you shamefully dance==.

I'm not particularly fair when I overlook that one Ramadan session you had. 


Under the hot sun, she's hungry and thirsty. She has no legs. Her hands have no family to hold onto. The little attention she gets all day from pedestrians is not because of her beauty. 






* I should focus on the unique portrayal of charity, build from it the compulsory nature of zakat.
* Where fasting will take you and a fresh new perspective of fasting.


* Give don't judge
* No one would ask if he didn't need it, don't assume unless you have clear proof which you often wouldn't have
* You always have something to give, and if you can give give.
* It's all a test from Allah, on both sides.
* It doesn't belong to you anyway, you found it here and you'll leave it
* Eventually what you give th byem is what was planned for them and what you don't give them is what wasn't planned for them. In other words, the benefit is for you entirely. 
* In other words you giving them or not has nothing to do with their sufferings for what they suffer is planned and this showcase the power of god's design.
* Some people are just not used to it, they don't feel good or bad just don't care, that it never occurred to them to help. Others are shy, they want to help but can't bring themselves to do it.

#### Fasting
I feel like I'm qualified to talk about fasting because I've made it a sport. It's my way of weight loss, mental energy boosting and reflection and body recreation. And it works. I will talk more about fasting in the upcoming article on which I take a 1 week fasting as an experiment and detail it.
1. If you fast consecutive days you reach a reverse point where eating is harder. You get used to the feeling.
2. You also reach a point where you can't get out of the bed but can't fall asleep either. You're hanging btn life and death.








Fasting makes you appreciate the gift of food. Fasting should be for a purpose. Once you lose purpose in what you do and who you are, then you're no different from an animal in the eyes of man. You can't just decide to fast, for then you won't make it and won't get the benefit of it. Muslims don't spend 30 days fasting just for the sake of it.



#### Exploitation
* The idea of some people exploiting the wicked is valid. But what has that got to do with you?
* At least they are managing them and help them. 
* Whether they are good or bad shouldn't matter to you because the benefits eventually is from God.
* 


#### Flow
* Starting from her. But why a girl? It's because a she is weaker. I have seen disabled men doing manual work, because of many in them.
* Going through all reasons why people would not lend a hand. 
* Why is there no a definitive programme from. The government or bodies of religions for these people? Hint on my project to make this possible and why it hasn't been possible so far.

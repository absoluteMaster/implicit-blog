There's no power greater than the power of passive dependency.                                                                                                          by MARILYN FRENCH.

A lot are the feelings we can't explain. Most are the things we have no control of. Even worse, of all the people, it's only a few that we have relevant connections with. The calm we blindly have is from the fact that this is as true to us as with everyone else. The world is designed so that, there's always a limit to "everything": You can't know it all and will not matter to all. The only thing that keeps us alive and kicking is dependency and, just like everyone, whether you like it or not, you are and will always be dependent. 

Dependency is not an option, but not always realized. A doctor will need a machine made by physicists. You won't need help to drive your car but you'll need good roads which are the works of engineers. Even if you could do everything, you would still depend on others because: time is limited, your energy is limited and even multitasking for an extraordinary human is limited. But things to do are unlimited and, even if they were limited, you can't prosecute, defend and still be the judge.

They say the only constant is change. Well, there's dependency. Dependency may come from the genes, but in this form it takes shape as we grow up. When we are born, that's when dependency gets it definition. Even the greatest, scariest and powerful people were helpless at that point in time. Left alone to wonder in the vastness of the earth, none of them would have become what they are. Even after becoming what they are, a good number of people are always behind the scenes. To some extent, they are who they are because they know how to take a good care of their back-end. Others become addicted to dependency, and only after being cut off do they finally realize it. In a great disturbance will be all who realize too late that dependency is all.

Great scientists have invented things from problems or other inventions. Yes sometimes from nothing, but an invention is hardly useful alone. What they invented centuries ago may not be useful today, but what is useful today is probably made of or from those inventions. Inventions may not be useful alone, but teamed up with others, we get wonders. What makes a great scientist or mathematician is the usefulness of something he created, even if he exclusively used the works of other scientists to create it. Just like that, most of things are created on top of existing technologies. Mathematical formulas are produced form known results. In the end, everything is a raw product of some other more complex things.

Knowing your dependencies is what makes you humble and wise. You become aware of your duties and responsibilities; and the lives you might affect by simply neglecting them. You will take care of things you depend on, like the environment and your health. You will understand the value of things and people and appreciate them.

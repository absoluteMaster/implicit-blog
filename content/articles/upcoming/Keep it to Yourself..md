You can't talk about it to anyone: for some reasons you don't have the guts or the energy to let these issues out, even though no one will force you to keep them in. You can't do these other things in the public unless you've some serious issues. And it just feels like the right thing to do, like there's a boundary you don't want to cross, a boundary set by no one else but your common sense. All these values are innate and they survived the diversity of societies and cultures thousands of years and they'll keep doing so for some time; or is it forever?

No, it's not forever. I have lived for a short but enough time to witness and learn the one true nature of things: change. Human beings are always once more curious about what they can do. We are never going to rest as long as there are boundaries or limitations. After all, breaking the boundaries is the real definition of human achievements: today we can fly to the moon and we can have a video call. But are all boundaries worth breaking? can all boundaries be broken?

I'll say it with confidence: not all boundaries should be broken, and, even if the whole world conspired to break all the boundaries, something which can never happen,  there will still be unbreakable boundaries. Maybe thanks to our little database of known boundaries, or maybe because there's a limit to what a human can do, or maybe both.

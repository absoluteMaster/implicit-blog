Victory comes from finding opportunities in problems.


Without notice, the virus crossed borders and some big tragedies went on happening. We are so lucky that the virus did nothing remarkable in our country even after doing nothing remarkable in dealing with it. Despite having this non-remarkable experience, I realized that, after putting the tiny little details together, I was able to capture the real picture and almost instantly realize, relate, create, or more simply understand that there's more to it than what it seems to be. That there's more to my covid story than one can simply imagine.

I imagined being a doctor treating covid-19 patients. In hospitals flooded with patients, at a time marked as just the beginning of the pandemic, the lives of the people are supposedly at my hands. The authorities confirmed the danger and addressed the majority about measures: stay as far as possible from those who show these symptoms. At the hospital, however, we make contact with the already infected, sometimes without even knowing. With the highest probability of getting infected and a predicted exponential increase of patients, I have to make a big decision. A very big decision.

The origins: the need for change does not come from nowhere

Any change is a consequence of some form, and its inevitability is a function of our activities: social, economic, political - anything we're are up to is a good enough variable. What you feel like today, what you consider right today; everything from withing to beyond is a product of many simple and eventually complicated instances, collected unsuspiciously over time. We are the ultimate industries capable of creating and even accepting everything, but within our ever expanding imaginations. 

The noun of all what we do extends a lot, but within a limit that only a few realize. This powerful, and with it a "limitless" attribute originating from the number of the unknowns of what we can do, or the intriguing and conspiracy-stricken end of the days, things are born from it as big as religions, unbelievable systems as convincing and cunning as feminism and all the modern devices of moderate creation and explosive destruction.

The acceptance and incorporation of the new is not a matter of breakthrough. Changes come designed and shaped enough to fit in exactly and satisfyingly. Some have to be shaped consciously by some driving forces, for their topology and geometry defy unconscious initiation. Other just fit in: thousands of years of certain activities have made it obvious that we asked for it. A reaction or an opposition is from the less developed, less exposed or, astonishingly, less educated. Yes, education is like a wide sea: not all from it is not poison to our minds and hearts. Today, they call us conservatives.

"Boy these conservatives are something aren't they? They are in the favor of the unborn, they'll do anything for the unborn, but once you're born you're on your own." by george carlin.

When it happens on the opposite side of the world, when it is accepted there, or anywhere else, they know how to proceed. They know not to give up. They know only hope and going forward. They know eventually their time will come, and all the tight spots will become loose. It gives them power and reason. It strengthen their belief of what is right, which is exactly what they fight for. That's how the world works; that's how humans are: extremely connected whether they like it or not. 

In school, our teachers kept telling us that only a very few of us are the problem. I don't know if this is some law of nature, but as it happens, even the changes we create are the same: a lot of positive and very few chronic and disgusting. But however few the trouble makers are, the problems they can bring have no limit. At any moment, there's always a good student they can spoil or convert. They are the viruses but the kind you can reprogram to be ineffective. How do we reprogram the bad changes?

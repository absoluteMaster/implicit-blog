Under the sun, she's hungry and thirsty. She has no legs to take her places, and no Family for the hands to hold onto. The little attention she gets all day from pedestrians isn't because of her beauty. What is even left of her state if food is the only priority she can afford? Nothing, In fact, all of her is not enough to get your attention. She's forced to perform. Poor little girl still has to look a stranger in the eyes and convince them what she deserves and why. You look at her and realize you have legs, and you could run. You walk away.

You then argue that I am blubbering without context, and you're mostly right. For even in dangerous situations, it is our bodies that will make instinctive Judgement. When stretched, It's as if God is telling us, "Don't judge a book by its cover," and when you must, "I've got you covered." But the point was you could run, and you know it.

Is it the performers?


* _Under the sun_ is both a place and a situation. It's a place outside, not under a roof. It's a situation of being exposed to the sun. The tone and the emphasis on the phrase, which is implied by its placement at the beginning, and the fact that she's thirsty, all emphasise that the it's hot.
* _She has no legs to take her places_. Legs is used as both a metaphor and as a literal leg. As a metaphor we consider it a means of livelihood: a purpose, money, and anything that would take her from one level to another. she has no access to exploration. The literal leg implies that she's amputated. both cases can be true independently or simultaneously about beggars.
* Even though she has hands, they remain useless. 
* She's not beautiful to at least catch the attention of a common man.
* legs in the final conclusion is for money or something a begger might need. the prophet says even if you don't have something, at least say to them kind words. some people have the tendency of interrogating beggers or insulting them. I you have money give them, if don't send them away or say a kind word. But the one i'm confronting could run. Running signifies the ultimate use of the legs.

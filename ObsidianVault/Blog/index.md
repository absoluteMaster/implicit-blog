# Capture

Oh! Not again. I often find myself forgetting what I wanted to say, and life has a way of making that even more regrettable. But this wasn't like a message to humanity; it was more about getting something off my chest.

Most of the time, though, I forget to document great ideas. **_.Implicit_**  is simply my way of capturing and sharing these thoughts. I hope you'll learn and enjoy reading them.

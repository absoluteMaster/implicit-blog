# Mind Your Arguments

*Originally written: October 25, 2021*

> â€” Andrew Wachter

When our brains think of, or receive from the ears and eyes in whatever form, the words from people, it creates something like a bundle or a package that encapsulates at the idea level, the meaning of and all the experiences and feelings we have about the words, and then evokes the bundle itself as a feeling. I call it the **bundle of suggestion**.

## The Bundle of Suggestion

It happens a lot that someone expresses his opinion about the word, or we come across a formal definition of the word. When the definition is in sync with the bundle of suggestion, we accept it with a clean heart. And in (often) rare cases where we've never heard a formal definition of the word, or when the definition itself is art, we feel stunned. We feel so satisfied, as if someone finally understands our feeling. Somehow, someone was able to express our feelings into words.

In mathematics, for example, you encounter an idea that is apparently true and you can clearly work it out in your mind. The brain was able to create the bundle of suggestion for the idea, incorporating in it the definition and correctness, but you can't seem to express it in formality. So it bugs you and keeps you uncomfortable. But then a mathematician provides a killer argument that is synchronous to the bundle. With the bug lifted, and back in comfort, you end up projecting endless appreciations.

## The Joy of Recognition

I have appreciated people this way and I can say that these appreciations are among the most honest you'll ever see. In fact, appreciating people this way is joy itself. Stopping yourself from it can be hard work and can make you stuffed. Kept inside, the feelings at that moment can make you a less better individual. You just have to put it all out, the pure satisfaction. My biggest dream is to one day give everyone this luxury of appreciating.

## The Gateway of Understanding

The bundle of feeling, as you might have figured already, acts as a gateway through which any familiar idea looking for our (further) understanding passes, and at which it gets checked for validity. When an idea is not in sync with the bundle, it's marked invalid and the brain throws a reactive feeling. If it's someone you're trying to convince, she feels attacked. She feels like you're playing with her brains and you want to command. Nobody wants that.

Those who mastered the art of convincing know how to play with your bundles. They combine them to forge a bundle in their favor, leaving you in contradictions. Now your bundle is vulnerable to attacks and no longer reactive.

## The Imperfection of Bundles

But convincing doesn't always require a professional. Sometimes an argument presented is enough to strike dead your bundle of suggestion for something. This is because the bundles themselves are generated by the data in our memories. Since we can't know everything, the bundles aren't always perfect. With fewer experience and knowledge, we may generate weak bundles very often. Furthermore, biased knowledge will create biased bundles.

At the end, someone from the other side of the story will say some unbelievable stuff that your mind can't process. All the constraints you're filled with are not met: how on earth can someone actually say or do or believe or behave...? Unbelievable!

## A Test Case: Infinity

Now calm down and tell me what is infinity like today? For me it feels like it's going and keeps going. In my mind it looks like a big number that keeps getting bigger for like forever. So I even dare to define it as a number that, when added to or multiplied by any number, including itself, the result is always itself.

How does this feel to you as a definition? Is it in sync with your bundle of infinity? To some people and to some extent, this definition is in sync with the bundle. But it's not logically satisfying, nevertheless. The bug in this definition is pretty obvious (sorry if you can't see it) but that's not always true for many things in life.

## The Lesson

This tells us that we are not always right. That the unbelievable may actually be the real deal. Even if you feel its truth to the bones, something can always be so wrong.

**Say what you mean, but don't say it mean.**

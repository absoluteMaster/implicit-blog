# The Turning Point

Is it really what they want? A life equal to that of a man.

Sometimes people don't really know what they want.

Is it necessary to give them what they should want? I keep this to myself.

## The Mystery Room

Now I'm alone in this room. You don't know where this is, and will probably never know. There's something I'm thinking about now. But I'll keep it to myself so that no one will ever know about it. Now the room you'll never know it, but you may know a place it is, and you may even see it without realizing that it is the room. But the thought, you will never know about it. Few years to come, the thought will be a mystery even to me.

Let's say you were going to give it a trial and think all you can think. Would you ever think of 'the number of full stops in this article'? Definitely no. First you just came across the article with a flow that keeps your thoughts so far away from its attributes. Maybe just now you're interested, but don't be. Nothing about this article is mind blowing, except for the fact that every paragraph was written by someone else.

## The Question of Identity

What if I don't know about the room either? Is there any probability for that? What if at some point, I was just like you, reading about a mysterious room in which a ghost writer was writing an article some time.

What if you're reading this article, 100 years later? The room may be long gone. I will be long gone. But the idea, the thought? What happens to it?

## The Collaborative Truth

So we were a group of five and we decided to create something like art. We decided to write an article and then I suggested that we write one paragraph each. But it should be one topic. I suggested the topic and we started writing. We selected one of our friends to write the starting paragraph. And for that, he'll have the authority over the topic. And the article should be as written by a hypothetical writer.

Amazing how I can have such power out of the box. Didn't require any practice or input. But what makes it greater is the number of people who have read it before you, you and those after you.

## The Attributes of Mystery

So this article has this attribute to have been written in an unknown room, by a person with some unknown thoughts. These attributes are not seen but you can feel them. And your brain accepts them.

But I'm the only one who knows about these facts, so you'll have to believe me even if I say the lies. What if I'm not in a room? What if all I'm thinking about is writing this article? What if the writer of this article is not actually me? Who is me?

## The Experiment

After five paragraphs, we decided to give the next reader a chance for a next paragraph. One submission and he gets either accepted or rejected. We decided to uncover the power of collaboration. We focused on one goal: to turn the topic into something touching to all people. The turning point, a paragraph that could rotate the earth, will be awarded.

Somehow I tried but I failed. But I tried. But I did the best part.
